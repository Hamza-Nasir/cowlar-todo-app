Task Review
- No compile/run time errors
- UI is clean but UX could be improved a bit
- Functionality is working as expected.
- Dockerization is done partially, need to implement the Docker-compose file as well

Some of the shortcomings have been identified below that need to be focused and fixed. 
Make sure to test your app before pushing it to the repository.

Web App
    - Use a config file together with .env file for app settings etc and push a sample.env file to your repo
    - Use toats for success/failure feedback to user and loaders for long running processes, data load
    - Good to have task states (Pending, Completed) with date/time visible for each task
    - Encapsulate API communication into a separate service with respect to a domain area e.g todo, user etc
API
    - Encapsulate business logic (creating tasks etc) into separate service instead of embedding it inside controllers/routes
    - Write unit tests using a separate test db for unit tests
    - Use a source code linter, e.g eslint with prettier and provide scripts
